        <P>My name is Quintin Martin Cheadle, I am from a small town, Olney, Maryland. I have swam my entire life, and have always known I wanted to swim in college. I have known I wanted to be a business major for a few years, when I determined that I wanted to own my own business one day.
        </P>
